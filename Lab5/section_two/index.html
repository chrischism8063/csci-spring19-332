        <dd>The main function of the UTP cable is to allow data to be transferred from a computer to another 
            computer or to network devices, creating a LAN, most commly utilized in networks in buildings.</dd>

        <dt>Describe the differences between the UTP cable and other types of cables that can be used in a
            network. Some of the differences might be data rates, and the networks they are used in.</dt>
        <dd>There are 4 different categories of physical media consisting of twisted-pair copper wire, 
            coaxial cable, fiber optics, terrestrial radio channels, and satellite radio channels.</dd>

            <li>Data Rates:
                <ul style="display:block">
                    <li>Twisted cable data rates range from 10Mbps to 10Gps.</li>
                    <li>Fiber optic cables data rates frange from 51.8 Mbps to 39.8 Mbps.</li>

                    <li>Twisted cables are the "dominant solution for high-speed LAN networking (Kurose 19).</li>
                    <li>Fiber optic cables are amazing long distances due to their high emi-resistance.</li>
                    <li>Terrestrial radio signals are a great option for long distance with capabilities to travel through walls and require no 
                        physical wire, but falls short when environmental factors are unstable, and are susceptable to electro-magnetic interference.</li>
